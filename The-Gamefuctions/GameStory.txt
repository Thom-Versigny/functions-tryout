The Backrooms


“I have an appointment with Dr. Pebins?” I asked.

“What time?”

“12:30,” I replied.

She began typing something into her keyboard.

“Ah, yes,” she responded. “Gary Johnston?”

“Mhm.”

“Yes, I’ll tell the doctor. Please fill this out.”

She handed me a clipboard which held a simple fill-out form. I walked back to the waiting area, took a seat, and began to fill out the form.

I was about halfway done with filling in my information, when I slumped back in my chair. I hadn’t gotten much sleep the night prior, and I was exhausted. As I slumped back, I noticed something very peculiar— my head never hit the wall. In fact, it felt like it went IN. I got up, quite frightened, and looked at the wall.

Nothing.

Not a single hole, or dent, had been made in the wall by my head.

So, I reached to touch the wall.

And my fingers went through it.

I recoiled in shock. “What the hell was that?” I thought, as I reached to touch the wall again, only to find my fingers clipped through once more.

Then, suddenly, I lost my balance, tripped, and fell directly through the wall. I fell face-first onto some dirty tan carpeting. Upon getting back up, I realized that I was in a completely different room. Well, not really a room, per se— more so a set of rooms, all of which connected by openings. The walls were covered in gross tan patterned wallpaper. There was also an overwhelming stench of moist carpet.

I turned back around and tried to put my hand back through the wall, and it wouldn’t go through. “Okay, what the fuck?” I muttered. I looked back into the room. There were no windows, no doors, nothing on the walls— other than that disgusting wallpaper, of course— it was completely empty. At this point, the only thing going through my mind was fear, and the repeating thought of “I need to leave” on loop in my head.
